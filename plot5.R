# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

# Choose all rows of column Short Name that contains "Highway Veh". This would perhaps 
# not capture lawn mowers, but I am assuming that the emission from the non-highway motor vehicles is
# much less than the highway vehicles.

# Merge the two datasets to get the names for each SCC.
data <- merge(NEI, SCC, by="SCC")

# Logical vector
vehicles = grepl("Highway Veh", data$Short.Name)

# Subset data
vehiclesdata <- data[vehicles & data$fips == "24510",]

# Aggregate emissions per year.
aggdata <- aggregate(data=vehiclesdata, Emissions~year, FUN=sum)
